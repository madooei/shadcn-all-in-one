# Roadmap for Shadcn All In One Package

This document outlines the roadmap for the Shadcn All In One package, detailing its current status, future plans, and key decisions made during development.

## Project Overview

The Shadcn All In One package provides a comprehensive React component library that consolidates all [shadcn UI components](https://ui.shadcn.com/) into a single, easy-to-use package. It demonstrates best practices for TypeScript React component development, tree-shaking optimization, peer dependency management, and modern build systems while providing the convenience of having all shadcn UI components in one place.

## Current Status

### What's Complete ‚úÖ

- **Complete shadcn UI Collection**: All shadcn UI components implemented and exported
- **Tree-Shaking Optimization**: Individual exports for optimal bundle sizes with deep entry points
- **Peer Dependencies**: Proper React, React-DOM, and Tailwind CSS peer dependency setup
- **Build System**: tsup configuration for ESM/CJS dual builds with React JSX support
- **Testing Framework**: Vitest with React Testing Library and jsdom environment
- **TypeScript Support**: Full type definitions with React component interfaces
- **Styling Integration**: Tailwind CSS integration with component library scanning
- **Development Tooling**: Complete toolchain (ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript)
- **Example Applications**: Working examples with Tailwind 3 and Tailwind 4 setups
- **Documentation System**: Comprehensive usage guides and integration examples
- **Additional Components**: Icons collection and enhanced components like TooltipButton
- **Category Exports**: Organized exports for hooks, contexts, providers, and utilities

### In Progress üöß

- **Component Testing**: Expanding test coverage for all components
- **Documentation Enhancement**: More detailed component usage examples
- **Performance Optimization**: Bundle size analysis and optimization

### Next Steps

- **Accessibility Features**: ARIA support and keyboard navigation improvements
- **Theme System**: Dynamic theming beyond Tailwind classes
- **Component Composition**: Advanced component patterns and render props

## Project Evolution

### Key Decisions Made

- **shadcn UI Consolidation**: Specialized for consolidating all shadcn UI components vs building custom components
- **Tree-Shaking First**: Individual component exports to minimize bundle impact
- **Deep Entry Points**: Direct exposure of component files without redundant export files
- **Peer Dependencies**: React as peer dependency to avoid version conflicts
- **JSX Preservation**: Build system preserves JSX for framework flexibility
- **Runtime Validation**: Peer dependency checks to provide helpful error messages
- **Additional Components**: Extended beyond shadcn UI with Icons and TooltipButton

### Learnings and Insights

- **Bundle Optimization**: Tree-shaking requires careful export structure design
- **Peer Dependencies**: Essential for React libraries to prevent version mismatches
- **Build Complexity**: React components need different build configuration than vanilla TS
- **Testing Requirements**: React components need specialized testing setup
- **Styling Strategy**: Component libraries need consistent styling approach
- **Export Strategy**: Deep entry points reduce maintenance while preserving tree-shaking

### Recent Changes

- Migrated from individual export files to deep entry points for cleaner architecture
- Added comprehensive shadcn UI component collection
- Implemented Icons collection with popular brand and utility icons
- Created TooltipButton component with enhanced functionality
- Enhanced tree-shaking with direct component file exposure
- Improved TypeScript configuration for React component development
- Added Tailwind CSS v4 support alongside v3 examples
- Implemented proper React Testing Library setup with jsdom
